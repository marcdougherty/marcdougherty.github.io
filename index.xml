&lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; of the time - there are still a few situations that I find challenging.
Notably, when a package does not comply with &lt;a
href="http://semver.org"
target="_blank"
&gt;semantic
versioning&lt;/a&gt; and makes API changes in minor versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Go communities focus on compatability, this does not usually
affect too many dependencies. Aside from the occasional mistake, two widely used
projects routinely disobey semantic versioning conventions - Kubernetes and
OpenTelemetry.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI Client libraries and their eccentricities</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-client-libraries-and-their-eccentricities/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-client-libraries-and-their-eccentricities/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As discussed earlier in this series, there are several factors that affect how
client libraries communicate with your AI Model service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll be demonstrating using some of the popular client
libraries to connect to models served in 3 different ways, to demonstrate the
usability and flexibility of these client libraries. For this comparison, I&amp;rsquo;ll
be using python since it is the most common choice in LLM user communities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI Model APIs</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-apis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-apis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As noted in the previous post about &lt;a
href="https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-serving-layers/"
target="_blank"
&gt;AI Model Serving layers&lt;/a&gt;, your serving layer determines which APIs are
presented, and which client libraries you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover the most common AI APIs and where you are likely to
encounter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group"&gt;Common APIs
&lt;div id="common-apis" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span
class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none"&gt;
&lt;a class="text-primary-300 dark:text-neutral-700 !no-underline" href="#common-apis" aria-label="Anchor"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These APIs are in widespread use for AI model serving. Most AI Model serving
layers will support both of these APIs. Chat-style completions are increasingly
popular, so if you are working with newer models, you should start there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI model serving layers</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-serving-layers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-serving-layers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to AI, most of the discussion focuses on the model itself, but
there&amp;rsquo;s an important decision that many organizations are overlooking - the
choice of their AI model serving layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of the model itself as a big bundle of data - many models are
distributed as a compressed archive of files. To make the model useful, you need
a way to query it - which is where model serving layers come in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Multi-cluster load balancing with Google Cloud</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/multi-cluster-load-balancing-with-google-cloud/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 13:17:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/multi-cluster-load-balancing-with-google-cloud/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To build a high-availability service in the cloud, we need to be able to serve from multiple independent failure domains. We can achieve this with multiple kubernetes clusters in different cloud regions, but we&amp;rsquo;ll need a load balancer that can route to all of our clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will provide an overview of 3 possible options for load balancing between kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud. Because I&amp;rsquo;m looking at this through the lens of Platform Engineering, I&amp;rsquo;ll also be discussing the breakdown of responsibilities and controls between a Platform team and an Application team.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building blocks of a Developer Platform</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/building-blocks-of-a-developer-platform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 11:35:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/building-blocks-of-a-developer-platform/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have read a lot of articles about Platform Engineering recently, and many of
them talk about platforms as a completely new way for your developers to work.
In fact, many of those articles are trying to sell you their platform!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series, I&amp;rsquo;ll be exploring how you can create a platform starting from
the tools and processes that your team is already using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing with a focus on software development teams working in a Cloud
environment, but most of this applies to other environments and teams, though

arbitrary set of GKE services as backends. To achieve this, I needed to learn
about 3 different methods of iteration that are supported in Terraform, when to
use each of them. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to better understand the many flavors of
iteration available in Terraform, this article can help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group"&gt;A bit of background

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal with this terraform module is to turn a list of
&lt;a
href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs/resources/service"
target="_blank"
&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubernetes_service&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

target="_blank"
&gt;&lt;code&gt;google_compute_backend_service&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This requires a few intermediate objects, and some json parsing in the
terraform. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about the outcome of this work, you can check out

some rough edges when these two systems interact. Kubernetes - specifically
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) makes extensive use of annotations to store
additional information about GKE resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encountered this when working on an &lt;a
href="https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/architecting-for-traffic-drains/"
target="_blank"
&gt;article about traffic drains&lt;/a&gt;, and
you can see it for yourself on Service objects. By default, GKE clusters
contain several services that show this - for example, you can inspect the
annotations on the built-in &lt;code&gt;default-http-backend&lt;/code&gt; service:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Architecting for Traffic Drains</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/architecting-for-traffic-drains/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/architecting-for-traffic-drains/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Distributed systems are capable of fast change and adaptation, and highly
tolerant of constrained failures. This is often achieved by building systems
that can exclude failing components from the larger system, but this capability
is not automatic. Many large systems use load balancers to &amp;ldquo;route around a
problem&amp;rdquo; by removing failed components. This process is often called &amp;ldquo;draining&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drains are a &lt;a
href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/generic-mitigations/"

&gt;generic
mitigation&lt;/a&gt;, which means
you can use them even if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand the cause of the problem (yet)!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Testing changes to Renovate configs</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/testing-changes-to-renovate-configs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 16:46:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/testing-changes-to-renovate-configs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I get a bit nervous whenever I touch &lt;code&gt;renovate.json&lt;/code&gt; files, because I did not

href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https"
target="_blank"
&gt;external application
loadbalancers&lt;/a&gt; in GCP, and I
found the data model pretty difficult to work with. What follows is an attempt
to better explain these concepts, practicing some of the advice from &lt;a
href="http://docsfordevelopers.com"
target="_blank"
&gt;Docs for
Developers&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 class="relative group"&gt;Overview
&lt;div id="overview" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External Application Loadbalancers are represented in the API by a series of
related configuration objects. There is no single &amp;ldquo;Loadbalancer&amp;rdquo; object, so it
is important to ensure the relevant objects all reference each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Day 2 Observability - calls to other services</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/day-2-observability-calls-to-other-services/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 16:33:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/day-2-observability-calls-to-other-services/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This post assumes you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with
&lt;a

target="_blank"
&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;, and are already collecting some
observability data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen automatic instrumentation, or manual, you&amp;rsquo;re now
collecting telemetry data from your code. Congratulations &amp;#x1f389;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about all the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; code you&amp;rsquo;re using? When your service makes a
database query, or fetches weather data, you&amp;rsquo;re using someone else&amp;rsquo;s code. These
other services may have their own production problems - can you separate issues
in your code from issues in a dependency with your current observability
signals?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>More Github CLI Tips</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/more-github-cli-tips/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 22:51:47 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/more-github-cli-tips/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I started working in a number of public Github repositories, and

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I need to pick a human to be responsible for something (usually
a PR review). When there is no obvious choice (for example, someone who already
knows the context of the PR), I caught myself relying on the same team members
repeatedly. While this is not a big issue, I wanted a more &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo; way to pick a

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, YAML (&lt;a

&gt;http://yaml.org&lt;/a&gt;) has become an essential part of software, particularly for infrastructure-as-code tools. Yaml at the heart of &lt;a

&gt;esp8266 IoT
button&lt;/a&gt;, I built a button my distant
family could use to request a refill of my home-made jam (though it could be
used for anything). To keep with the theme, i built the whole thing to fit in a
standard 8oz jam jar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the inspiration, this button should be able to live for months in the

powerswitch&lt;/a&gt; which is pretty much
exactly what i needed. Throw a micro-lipo battery charge circuit in there and

&gt;sfmta data&lt;/a&gt; shows a ~60% on-time rate (where &amp;ldquo;on-time&amp;rdquo; includes arriving anywhere between 1 minute before to 4 minutes after the intended time). Fortunately, they provide real-time arrival estimates with the &lt;a

I sometimes find myself using a computer, and have a hard time remembering the
unicode identifiers for a nice cup of tea (1f375 - 🍵 ) or a suitable warning
character (2620 - ☠ ). So I decided to make a supplemental Unicode keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img

&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="relative group"&gt;Code
&lt;div id="code" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span
class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none"&gt;
&lt;a class="text-primary-300 dark:text-neutral-700 !no-underline" href="#code" aria-label="Anchor"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code can be found on Github: &lt;a
href="http://github.com/muncus/unicode-keyboard"

&gt;http://github.com/muncus/unicode-keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. User-servicable parts are in
&lt;code&gt;config.h&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Big Red Button</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/archive/big-red-button/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/archive/big-red-button/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was working on a particularly challenging service turndown, which
involved handholding some user migrations. During the waiting periods, it
occurred to me that turning off the service by simply typing the right command
lacked a certain &lt;em&gt;gravity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I grabbed a &lt;a

&gt;Bluefruit EZ-key&lt;/a&gt;
(12-key programmable bluetooth keyboard), a big red arcade button, and a 9-volt
battery. Using the &lt;a

docs&lt;/a&gt;,
it was simple to get the button working. But it still wasnt &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; right.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>First Post!</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/archive/first-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/archive/first-post/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;First Post!
