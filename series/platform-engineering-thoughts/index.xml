them talk about platforms as a completely new way for your developers to work.
In fact, many of those articles are trying to sell you their platform!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series, I&amp;rsquo;ll be exploring how you can create a platform starting from
the tools and processes that your team is already using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing with a focus on software development teams working in a Cloud
environment, but most of this applies to other environments and teams, though
some interpretation may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
