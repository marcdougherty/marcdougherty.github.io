client libraries communicate with your AI Model service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll be demonstrating using some of the popular client
libraries to connect to models served in 3 different ways, to demonstrate the
usability and flexibility of these client libraries. For this comparison, I&amp;rsquo;ll
be using python since it is the most common choice in LLM user communities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI Model APIs</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-apis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-apis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As noted in the previous post about &lt;a

target="_blank"
&gt;AI Model Serving layers&lt;/a&gt;, your serving layer determines which APIs are
presented, and which client libraries you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover the most common AI APIs and where you are likely to
encounter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="relative group"&gt;Common APIs
&lt;div id="common-apis" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span
class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none"&gt;
&lt;a class="text-primary-300 dark:text-neutral-700 !no-underline" href="#common-apis" aria-label="Anchor"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These APIs are in widespread use for AI model serving. Most AI Model serving
layers will support both of these APIs. Chat-style completions are increasingly
popular, so if you are working with newer models, you should start there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI model serving layers</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-serving-layers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-serving-layers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to AI, most of the discussion focuses on the model itself, but
there&amp;rsquo;s an important decision that many organizations are overlooking - the
choice of their AI model serving layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of the model itself as a big bundle of data - many models are
distributed as a compressed archive of files. To make the model useful, you need
a way to query it - which is where model serving layers come in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
