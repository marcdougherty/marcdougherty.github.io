In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover the most common AI APIs and where you are likely to encounter them.
Common APIs # These APIs are in widespread use for AI model serving. Most AI Model serving layers will support both of these APIs. Chat-style completions are increasingly popular, so if you are working with newer models, you should start there.</description></item><item><title>AI model serving layers</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-serving-layers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2024/ai-model-serving-layers/</guid><description>When it comes to AI, most of the discussion focuses on the model itself, but there&amp;rsquo;s an important decision that many organizations are overlooking - the choice of their AI model serving layer.
You can think of the model itself as a big bundle of data - many models are distributed as a compressed archive of files. To make the model useful, you need a way to query it - which is where model serving layers come in.</description></item></channel></rss>
