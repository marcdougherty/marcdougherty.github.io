Hi! I'm Marc. I live in San Francisco, work in technology, and enjoy a good burrito.
In addition to tinkering with technology, I have several other hobbies:

- *Sailing* - I sometimes volunteer on the [Alma](http://www.nps.gov/safr/learn/historyculture/alma.htm), but mostly sail smaller boats, like J/24s.
- *Woodworking* - I build small furniture, and carve spoons. Most of my work is done without the aid of power tools (except for sanding).
- *Cooking / Baking* - Most of my baking is desserts, but I'm working up to bread.
- *Gardening* - Container garden for now, as I do not have a yard.

I enjoy working with my hands, and preserving "old" ways.
