Hi! I'm Marc. I recently moved to Seattle (from San Francisco), work in
technology, and enjoy a good burrito.
In addition to tinkering with technology, I have several other hobbies:

- *Sailing* - In 2016, I trained on board the [Hawaiian
  Chieftain](http://www.historicalseaport.org/ships/hawaiian-chieftain/)
  learning to sail tall ships, and also educating young students about the life
  of a 17th century tall ship sailor. I used to volunteer on the
  [Alma](http://www.nps.gov/safr/learn/historyculture/alma.htm), and now mostly
  sail smaller boats, like J/24s.
- *Woodworking* - I build small furniture, and carve spoons. Most of my work is
  done without the aid of power tools (except for sanding).
- *Cooking / Baking* - Most of my baking is desserts, and I'm starting to get
  into bread.
- *Gardening* - Container garden for now, as I do not have a yard.

I enjoy working with my hands.
