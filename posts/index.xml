This is often achieved by building systems that can exclude failing components from the larger system, but this capability is not automatic. Many large systems use load balancers to &amp;ldquo;route around a problem&amp;rdquo; by removing failed components. This process is often called &amp;ldquo;draining&amp;rdquo;.
Drains are a generic mitigation, which means you can use them even if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand the cause of the problem (yet)!</description></item><item><title>Testing changes to Renovate configs</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/testing-changes-to-renovate-configs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 16:46:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/testing-changes-to-renovate-configs/</guid><description>I get a bit nervous whenever I touch renovate.json files, because I did not know how to test the effects of my changes. Well, this week I spent some quality time with Renovate and while the results are not perfect, they&amp;rsquo;re a lot better than what I had before!
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Renovate, it is a convenient way to keep your dependencies up to date. It understands dependencies in many language ecosystems, and supports a variety of ways to run and configure Renovate.</description></item><item><title>Understanding GCP's Loadbalancer models</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/understanding-gcps-loadbalancer-models/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 16:50:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/understanding-gcps-loadbalancer-models/</guid><description>I recently spent some time with external application loadbalancers in GCP, and I found the data model pretty difficult to work with. What follows is an attempt to better explain these concepts, practicing some of the advice from Docs for Developers, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading.
Overview # External Application Loadbalancers are represented in the API by a series of related configuration objects. There is no single &amp;ldquo;Loadbalancer&amp;rdquo; object, so it is important to ensure the relevant objects all reference each other.</description></item><item><title>Day 2 Observability - calls to other services</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/day-2-observability-calls-to-other-services/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 16:33:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/day-2-observability-calls-to-other-services/</guid><description>This post assumes you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with OpenTelemetry, and are already collecting some observability data.
Whether you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen automatic instrumentation, or manual, you&amp;rsquo;re now collecting telemetry data from your code. Congratulations &amp;#x1f389;
But what about all the other code you&amp;rsquo;re using? When your service makes a database query, or fetches weather data, you&amp;rsquo;re using someone else&amp;rsquo;s code. These other services may have their own production problems - can you separate issues in your code from issues in a dependency with your current observability signals?</description></item><item><title>More Github CLI Tips</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/more-github-cli-tips/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 22:51:47 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/more-github-cli-tips/</guid><description>Last year, I started working in a number of public Github repositories, and learned to use the gh Github CLI. I wrote an article about using the github cli with multiple repos, but given how much my workflow has changed, I think its time for an update.
Picking a random teammate # Sometimes, I need to pick a human to be responsible for something (usually a PR review). When there is no obvious choice (for example, someone who already knows the context of the PR), I caught myself relying on the same team members repeatedly.</description></item><item><title>Handy Yaml Tricks!</title><link>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/handy-yaml-tricks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.marcdougherty.com/2023/handy-yaml-tricks/</guid><description>(This content was originally published at https://dev.to/muncus/handy-yaml-tricks-415p)
In the past few years, YAML ( http://yaml.org) has become an essential part of software, particularly for infrastructure-as-code tools. Yaml at the heart of kubernetes configuration, kubernetes-inspired APIs like Google&amp;rsquo;s config connector, and a number of workflow systems like Google Cloud Workflows and Github Actions.
In its simplest forms, Yaml is quite human-readable, but over time many of these configurations become more complex, and the documentation of these formats is not always as complete or searchable as we might like.</description></item></channel></rss>
