title:  "Unicode Emoji Quick Reference"
---

Unicode/Emoji is becoming a common method of communication. While mobile
platforms have decent unicode input, traditional computing platforms are sadly
lacking. To help that, i'm making a table to help with referencing the
codepoint numbers for characters commonly used (by me).

> Note that some characters do not appear correctly. these are likely the newer
> characters added in the 2015 update (like TACO).
